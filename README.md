Shades of Green is a web app that allows you to search for places around you, or any other city all around the world, and vote for how vegan-friendly they are. Also, it allows you to filter the search by type (restaurant, shop, supermarket, vegan, etc.) and provides basic info about the place (like opening hours, address, etc.).
